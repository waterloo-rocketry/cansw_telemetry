  @File Name
    spi.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the SPI driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for SPI.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.4
        Device            :  PIC16LF1455
        Driver Version    :  2.0.0
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.20 and above or later
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 5.40
